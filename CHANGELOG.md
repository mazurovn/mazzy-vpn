# Changelog

All notable changes to Mazzy VPN are documented here.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-26

- Introduced the `mazzy-vpn` CLI/TUI with `vpnctl` and `mazzyvpn` aliases.
- Added a live dashboard with connection checks, selected location, default
  config, handshake, public IP, autostart and health-monitor state.
- Added `mazzy-vpn quick` for one-command connection through the saved default.
- Added installer and TUI language selection for RU, EN, DE, ZH, JA and KO.
- Added AmneziaWG, WireGuard, OpenVPN and NetworkManager L2TP/IPsec profiles.
- Added recursive profile-folder detection, validation and safe import.
- Added endpoint probes, doctor, diagnose, self-test and live test-all.
- Added transactional rollback, independent timeout guard, boot recovery and
  health watchdog.
- Hardened unattended recovery: immediate restart of an inactive desired
  service, reconnect after two confirmed traffic failures, dual HTTPS health
  probes and a roughly 20-second monitoring interval.
- Fixed the interactive TUI action-lock lifetime so an idle menu cannot block
  the independent health monitor.
- Added safe handling of external VPN fallback conflicts.
- Added validated AdGuard PID-file detection and cleanup when its status command
  cannot access the already-running tunnel session.
- Added automatic deduplication of stale WireGuard/AmneziaWG policy rules.
- Fixed systemd start-limit exhaustion during large profile test batches.
- Added explicit OpenVPN server-halt, authentication and
  `Too many connections` diagnostics with retryable service failures.
- Added six-language documentation, Bash completion, CI and public-repository
  secret/PII audit.
