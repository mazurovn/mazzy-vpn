# Changelog

All notable changes to Mazzy VPN are documented here.

## Unreleased

- Bumped the shared engine to 1.2.0 and the Desktop Linux preview to 0.2.0.
- Expanded Desktop from a dashboard companion into a Linux control center with
  Dashboard, Profiles, Diagnostics and Settings screens.
- Bundled the engine installer and required public runtime resources in Desktop
  packages, with installed/bundled version and dependency readiness checks plus
  an explicitly authorized install, update and repair workflow.
- Added sanitized profile discovery, search and selection; safe single/multiple
  file and folder import; connect, validate, probe, transactional test,
  test-all, emergency and profile removal actions.
- Added complete retained output for Doctor, approved Doctor fixes, offline/live
  self-tests and bounded service logs.
- Added Desktop controls for engine autostart and the independent recovery
  monitor.
- Added a typed Rust operation adapter with fixed argument construction, path
  and value validation, output sanitization and unit tests; no UI text is
  converted into a shell command.
- Added CLI `profiles --json`, `import-files`, independent `monitor on|off` and
  bounded `logs --lines`, with sanitized caches and regression coverage.
- Defined the standalone Desktop 1.0 architecture: one shared core and local
  API for independently usable CLI, TUI and Desktop clients.
- Added a machine-validated cross-surface capability registry and release gates
  that prevent a preview from being labeled as a complete Desktop client.
- Added bilingual Desktop roadmap, feature-parity matrix, PR checklist and a
  capability issue template.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-26

- Added English and Russian architecture documentation with component,
  connection, recovery and transactional rollback diagrams.
- Updated the installer and post-install checks to preserve the architecture
  documentation in `/usr/local/lib/mazzy-vpn/docs`.
- Added a sanitized machine-readable `status --json` cache that exposes no VPN
  endpoint, profile path, private key or configuration directive.
- Added a Tauri 2 Desktop Dashboard with six UI languages, connection health,
  default location, protocol, interface, handshake, public-IP privacy toggle,
  profile counts and activity state.
- Added a system tray menu for Quick Connect, Reconnect, Disconnect, Refresh,
  Self-diagnostics and Quit.
- Added functional Linux AppImage, DEB and RPM bundle builds. macOS and Windows
  bundles are explicitly labeled as UI previews until native VPN backends are
  implemented.
- Added pinned multi-platform GitHub Actions, Rust unit tests, Clippy checks and
  npm dependency auditing for Desktop.
- Added bilingual Desktop guides, updated all six project guides and added
  Dashboard images for the repository and Wiki.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-26

- Introduced the `mazzy-vpn` CLI/TUI with `vpnctl` and `mazzyvpn` aliases.
- Added a live dashboard with connection checks, selected location, default
  config, handshake, public IP, autostart and health-monitor state.
- Added `mazzy-vpn quick` for one-command connection through the saved default.
- Added installer and TUI language selection for RU, EN, DE, ZH, JA and KO.
- Added AmneziaWG, WireGuard, OpenVPN and NetworkManager L2TP/IPsec profiles.
- Added recursive profile-folder detection, validation and safe import.
- Added endpoint probes, doctor, diagnose, self-test and live test-all.
- Added transactional rollback, independent timeout guard, boot recovery and
  health watchdog.
- Hardened unattended recovery: immediate restart of an inactive desired
  service, reconnect after two confirmed traffic failures, dual HTTPS health
  probes and a roughly 20-second monitoring interval.
- Fixed the interactive TUI action-lock lifetime so an idle menu cannot block
  the independent health monitor.
- Added safe handling of external VPN fallback conflicts.
- Added validated AdGuard PID-file detection and cleanup when its status command
  cannot access the already-running tunnel session.
- Added automatic deduplication of stale WireGuard/AmneziaWG policy rules.
- Fixed systemd start-limit exhaustion during large profile test batches.
- Added explicit OpenVPN server-halt, authentication and
  `Too many connections` diagnostics with retryable service failures.
- Added six-language documentation, Bash completion, CI and public-repository
  secret/PII audit.
